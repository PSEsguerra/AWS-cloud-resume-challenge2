## Challenge stages

### Stage 0 - Certification

First challenge is to complete [AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/80423ecd-aa24-4735-870a-3ad5159b4725/linked_in_profile) certification exam.\
I successfully passed the exam in February 2024.
Follwing this exam I was a little scared that I was going to forget all the information I just studied for so I took this part of the challenge step further
and went and studied and passed the [AWS Solutions Architect - Associate Exam](https://www.credly.com/badges/76dc93df-1c9d-40bb-942f-6ff74999a4de/linked_in_profile).

### Stage 1 - Creating Front End

This section is about building the visual representation of resume using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (which gets more important at stage 2).

I was very new to programming to start this challange so I went and found some HTML templates online so that I could have something to work with and
help familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That is when I came across [HTML5up website](https://html5up.net/) which had all this components
in a template format and I can reconfigure the website and make it my own while learning how to use frontend programming languages. 

### Stage 2 - Building the API



### Stage 3 - Frontend & Backend integration


### Stage 4 - Automation & CI/CD
